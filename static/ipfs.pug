    p With IPFS (see the #[a(href="https://ipfs.io") official website]), a copy of the site and the whole index can be distributed just like a torrent. When you open it via IPFS, your IPFS node fetches the parts of the index and website it needs from the network.
    p To use it without the public server, use #[a(href="https://ipfs.io") IPFS]. Address in IPFS is #[a(href="https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/12D3KooWB3GY1u6zMLqnf3MJ8zhX3SS1oBj7VXk3xp6sJJiFGZXp") /ipns/torrent-paradise.ml]. You can also use /ipns/12D3KooWB3GY1u6zMLqnf3MJ8zhX3SS1oBj7VXk3xp6sJJiFGZXp in case the domain doesn't work.
